# Event Stream Prototype

Prototyping an custom event streaming library written from scratch in Rust.

> **Please note**: this is a hobby project created by an over caffinated bored software developer with way to much time on his hands. No one should use this in production. You will not recieve support if something breaks.

## Goals

-   [x] Create a system where n+1 number of producers can submit data
-   [x] Log data
-   [x] Create a system where n+1 number of approved consumers can sequentially read the data
-   [x] Create a system where a new consumer could process all previous data
-   [x] Create a system where a new consumer could join the live data stream after processing the entire log
-   [x] Create a system where consumers can fail & recover during the reading process
-   [x] Add persistence to consumer read statuses
-   [x] Add consumer status endpoint
-   [x] Setup spawnable consumer nodes
-   [x] Add consumer acknowledgement endpoint
-   [x] Custom event format
    -   [x] UUIDs
    -   [x] Event recieved timestamp
    -   [x] Custom message lengths
    -   [x] Data
-   [ ] Allow consumers to request batched events
-   [ ] Switch all file system write OPs to `BufWriter`
-   [ ] Allow consumers to rewind
-   [ ] Add a process to compact old logs
-   [ ] Distributed brokers/logs
-   [ ] Switch message UUIDs to time-ordered UUIDs
-   [ ] Index min & max timestamps for each events file
-   [ ] Allow observers to query events like a time series database
    -   [ ] ranges `SELECT * IN group FROM timestamp TO timestamp`
    -   [ ] time slices `SELECT * IN group FROM timestamp SAMPLE BY 5m`
-   [ ] Add the ability to create groups
-   [ ] Allow producers to push data into groups
-   [ ] Allow consumers to "subscribe" (assign) to a group
-   [ ] Come up with a cleaver catchy name for this project
-   [ ] Manually convert the `Event` struct into a response `String` (parsing the stored `json::Value` message is resouce intensive process that we should avoid)
-   [ ] Drop actix dependency and write the server/router from scratch ([ref](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html))
-   [ ] Create a web interface
    -   [ ] Manage consumers (add, remove, set group, set delivery type)
    -   [ ] Manage producers (add, remove, set group)
    -   [ ] Manage groups (add, remove)

## Technology
