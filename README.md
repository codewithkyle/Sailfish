# Event Stream Prototype

Exploring and prototyping a custom event streaming architecture.

## Goals

-   [x] Create a system where n+1 number of producers can submit data
-   [x] Log data
-   [ ] Create a system where n+1 number of approved consumers can sequentially read the data
-   [ ] Create a system where a new consumer could process all previous data
-   [ ] Create a system where a new consumer could join the live data stream after processing the entire log
-   [ ] Create a system where consumers can fail & recover during the reading process
-   [ ] Add persistence to consumer read statuses

## Technology

-   Producers: web browsers (JavaScript)
-   Broker(s): Rust
-   Consumners: NodeJS
